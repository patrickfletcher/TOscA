# OscAr

## An Oscillation Analyzer for timeseries data

OscAr is a collection of Matlab tools for performing preprocessing and analysis of timeseries data typical of fluoresence video microscopy, namely where many cells (regions of interest) are subjected to the same experimental condition. Analysis is performed for all ROIs simultaneously with one set of analysis parameters for the whole recording. Flexible analysis piplines can be constructed by applying combinations of preprocessing steps before performing feature extraction. Preprocessing tools include several options for normalization, detrending, and smoothing. Feature extraction methods are based on peak and period detection, allowing quantification of many timeseries features. OscAr can be used in both a scripting mode or via graphical user interface.  

## Usage

The analysis subroutines can be used *via* scripts or a graphical interface.
